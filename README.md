	    <h1> My Introduction</h1>
		<p>Hello <br>
		    My Name is Ashok Jaipal and currently pursuing B.Tech from NIT Trichy Major in Producion Engineering.
		    I am very interested in Web Development Domain and for that i have done some online courses and participated in
		    online challenges.Apart from this, i have opted Web Technology as Elective Subject that really helped me a lot to gain deep knowledge in this. It was really not easy for me to set up myself in this domain as i am from non circtuital branch.<br>
		    I did hard work to gain experience in coding. Before joining college, i didn't have  a single word knowledge of
		    Coding but here i found my interest and now i have good knowledge of Front-End.<br>
		    To explore myself  in industry, I started my journey with an internship. i joined olcademy in my first year itself and closely worked with Web Development team and assigned them task, set the deadlines, represented team in front of higher archi of organization.
